# SolarWinds Xui Platform

The SolarWinds Xui platform provides a set of common user interface components and services to assist with rapid web application development. Xui is based on AngularJS and Bootstrap. It follows modern UX design principles and font-end software development practices.

# Demo

To see the Xui platform in action? Visit the Demo page <a href="http://apollo-docs.swdev.local/xui/develop/" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Installation

Installation is simple as Xui includes all of its dependencies as part of the final build such as AngularJS, Bootstrap, ui-router, angular-ui-bootstrap, and more.

#### Install with Bower
```sh
$ npm install @solarwinds\xui
```

### Adding the Xui module to your project

When you are done downloading all the dependencies and project files the only remaining part is to add the Xui module to your AngularJS application:

```js
angular.module('myModule', ['xui']);
```

If you're a Browserify or Webpack user, you can do:

```js
var xui = require('xui');

angular.module('myModule', [xui]);
```
