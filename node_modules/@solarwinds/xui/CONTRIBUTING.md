## Got a question or problem?

Firstly, please go over our FAQ: https://github.com/solarwinds/Xui/FAQ

Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

ApolloEngineering@solarwinds.com is a much better place to ask questions.

## Find a bug?

In order to reproduce bugs we will ask you to provide a _minimal_ repro scenario using http://plnkr.co/. Having a live scenario gives us important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:
* version of this library that you are using
* 3rd-party libraries used, if any
* and most importantly - a use-case that fails

A minimal scenario using http://plnkr.co/ allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

## You want to contribute some code?

We currently are not accepting contributions to this library.
