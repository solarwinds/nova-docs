The styling can be altered by applying a class to the container element.\r\n * Currently supported classes are xui-dropdown-inline and xui-dropdown--justified.\r\n *\r\n * @parameters\r\n * @param {string=} caption Value used as a label for the dropdown.\r\n * @param {boolean=} is-disabled Value used to set dropdown to read only mode.\r\n * @param {array} items-source Array of values that are bound to the list of dropdown items. If the array itself\r\n * consists of several arrays, e. g. [[\"item 1\", \"item 2\"], [\"item 3\", \"item 4\"]], each of the sub-arrays will be\r\n * treated as a separate group of items. Logical separators will be shown between these groups.\r\n * @param {function=} on-changed Callback event when the current selection has changed.\r\n * @param {function=} on-secondary-action Callback event that provides split-button behavior and interaction.\r\n * @param {string=} displayFormat Template for formatting selected item on the dropdown button.\r\n * @param {string=} displayValue Name of the item property that will be shown in the dropdown menu.\r\n * @param {function=} displayValueFn Template function for formatting items in dropdown.\r\n * @param {object=} ng-model This component also supports `ng-model` directive for binding to forms.\r\n * @param {object=} selected-item Two-way model value that contains the currently selected item.\r\n * @param {string=} item-template-url URL of the content to load for the items in the dropdown.\r\n * @param {string=} placeholder Text displayed when no item is selected.\r\n * @param {boolean=} is-required Indicates whether a selection must be made for validation.\r\n * @param {boolean=} is-editable Turns the dropdown into a combobox.\r\n * @param {boolean=} clear-on-blur Clears combobox input if its value is not in a source array.\r\n * @param {boolean=} dropdown-append-to-body Appends the menu to '$body' instead of the parent element.\r\n * @internalParam {Boolean} [single-value-hide=false] Hides dropdown button if items-source array consists of 1 element.\r\n * @example\r\n *    <example module=\"xui\">\r\n *        <file src=\"src/components/dropdown/docs/dropdown-examples.html\"

@param {boolean=} is-ellipsis-enabled Flag for turning tooltip on/off from outer controller.\r\n * @param {boolean=} append-to-body If set to true the ellipsis element will be appended at the end of

set fixed width (like container). <br>\r\n *  If you get into trouble (probably you trying to nest more ellipsis) you can\r\n *  specify what's the name of parent class, instead of `find-parent-class=\"true\"`, <br> you can\r\n *  use`<div class=\"my-class-name\">..<span ellipsis find-parent-class=\"my-class-name\"></span>..</div>`\r\n * @param {xui.IEllipsisOptions} ellipsis-options Object width currently available parameters:\r\n * @param {string} [ellipsis-options.tooltipText=''] Full text for tooltip usage.\r\n * @param {IEllipsisTooltipOptions=}

xui.directive:xuiGrid\r\n * @restrict E\r\n *\r\n * @description\r\n * Apollo implementation of grid with sorting, paging, and searching controls. The grid supports two modes:\r\n * <p>\r\n * 1. In default mode, it acts as a simple UI control that exposes API of underlying UI controls, that is - pager,\r\n * sorter, and listview. It displays data in the listview and executes related callbacks on data change invoked by\r\n * respective controls, but it doesn't apply any changes to displayed data depending on pagination and sorter.\r\n * </p>\r\n * <p>\r\n * 2. With `smart-mode=\"true\"`, it works as a smart control that actually applies sorting and pagination to given data\r\n * depending on contained sorter and pager controls. In such case, the <code>IGridPagination.total</code> is derived\r\n * from the length of given data and ignores the supplied value for total.\r\n * </p>\r\n * These two can be simply understood as server (default) and client (smart-mode=\"true\") modes.\r\n *\r\n * Inner directive <xui-grid-toolbar-container> can be used to define toolbar displayed above the grid.\r\n *\r\n * @parameters\r\n * @param {array} items-source Array of items to be displayed in the table.\r\n * @param {IGridPagination} pagination-data Data used by pager.\r\n * @param {IGridSorting} sorting-data Interface data used by sorter.\r\n * @param {function} on-pagination-change Callback for pagination change.\r\n * @param {function} on-sorting-change Callback for sorting change.\r\n * @param {string} header-template-url Template to be used as a header row.\r\n * @param {string} template-url Template to be used as a fallback for all rows without their own templateURL.\r\n * @param {function} template-fn Function returning template ID for given row.\r\n * @param {string} [track-by] The property name that would be used for track by in ngRepeat. If no value is specified,\r\n * or the property does not exist on the item, the auto-generated by angular hash will be used for key.\r\n * @param {ListSelectionModeEnum} [selection-mode] Can be \"single\" or \"multi\".\r\n * Use \"multi\" to display checkboxes on every row. If this value is not set, selection will be disabled.\r\n * @param {string} selection-property Property of item that will be used for selection model. <i>Attention!</i> It is\r\n * necessary to use selection-property when smart-mode is not enabled and anytime the items can be dynamic. Storing\r\n * whole object into selection array (i.e. not using selection-property) could lead to sychronization fail between the\r\n * selection and items-source.\r\n * @param {IGridSelection} selection Array of selected items when \"multi\" selection mode is used.\r\n * @param {boolean=} [stripe=true] Whether the rows should be striped.\r\n * @param {boolean} [smart-mode=false] Whether client side processing of pagination/sorting should be used.\r\n * @param {boolean} [hide-toolbar=false] Whether the toolbar should be visible.\r\n * @param {boolean} [show-selector=false] Whether the selector should be visible.\r\n * It works only for selection-mode=\"multi\".\r\n * @param {boolean} [allow-select-all-pages=true] False to hide \"All Pages\" item in selector default item list\r\n * (passed to Selector component).\r\n * @param {any} [controller] Controller used in listview template.\r\n * @param {IEmptyData} empty-data Empty data parameters object\r\n * @param {boolean=} show-empty Show empty state or not(Hiding empty state before data is loaded for example)\r\n * @param {function} on-search The callback function that is called when the search is applied.\r\n * @param {function} on-clear The callback function that is called when the search field is cleared.\r\n * @param {IGridOptions} options Configuration of grid list. Currently available\r\n * options are:\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.hidePagination=true] Whether the pagination is displayed or not.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.hideSearch = false] Whether the search field is displayed or not.\r\n * @param {number} options.searchDebounce The debounce time in milliseconds of calling the onSearchChange function.\r\n * @param {boolean} options.triggerSearchOnChange Whether the search is triggered after each change in search text.\r\n * @param {string[]} options.searchableColumns Columns which will be checked during search.\r\n * @param {string} options.searchTerm The initial search term used in the searchbox.\r\n * @param {string} options.searchPlaceholder The placeholder displayed in search input when no search text\r\n * is defined.\r\n * @param {number=} [options.pagerAdjacent=\"1\"] It determines the adjacent for pagination layout. Options are:\r\n * '1' (extended layout), '0' (minified layout).\r\n * @param {array} smart-items-source Array of items visible to the user in the current. moment when pagination is\r\n * applied and smart-mode=\"true\".\r\n * @param {string} [row-padding=\"regular\"] determines the padding of the row around the content. Options are:\r\n * 'regular' (15px), 'narrow' (15px; 7px), 'compact' ( 5px; 7px) or 'none' (0px).\r\n * @param {String=} [layout=\"default\"] If attribute equals to \"fill\", layout of <strong>xuiGrid</strong> will be\r\n * changed from default to fill, so <strong>xuiGrid</strong> height will be equal to parent element height. Parent\r\n * element should have specified height. In case you need to use default layout, set \"layout\" attribute to \"default\"\r\n * or do not specify the attribute at all\r\n *\r\n * @example\r\n *   <example module=\"xui\">\r\n *       <file

This parameter can be combined with <code>xuiPopoverIcon</code> parameter to\r\n * dispaly icon with status together, the child status is supported as well.\r\n * @param {boolean=} xuiPopoverIsDisplayed This parameter provides programmatic access to opening/closing the popover.\r\n * @param {boolean=} xuiPopoverIsModal Display popover in a modal fashion (with a darkened backdrop on top of the page).\r\n * @param {function=} xuiPopoverOnShow Callback triggered when popover is being shown.\r\n * @param {function=} xuiPopoverOnHide Callback triggered when popover is being hidden.\r\n * @param {object=} xuiPopoverElement This is an advanced property. Use it only if you know what you're doing.\r\n * Allows you to bind the popover to an element provided through reference.
