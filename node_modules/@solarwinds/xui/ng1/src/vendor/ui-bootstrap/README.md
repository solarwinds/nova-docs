As part of bundle optimization for Oregon release, we created this custom build of Angular UI Bootstrap library.
As of now (2017-08-09) we're using version 1.3.3, so the link to generate a custom bundle is in the header of this page:

http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/versioned-docs/1.3.3/

We're currently using these components:

    Collapse
    Datepicker
    Datepicker Popup
    Popover
    Tabs
    Position
    Dropdown
    Modal
    Tooltip
    Typeahead
