Hello friend. In case you are not familiar with Docker and want to learn more, please spend
some time researching this page: https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview

If you know what it is or your main goal right now is just spin up the repo, feel free
to skip docs and proceed.

If you don't have docker installed: https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community
Find installer that matches your platform and install it.
