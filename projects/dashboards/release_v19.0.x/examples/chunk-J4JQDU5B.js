The KPI widget displays the current measurement of a KPI as a single numeric value and can display one or more individual metrics within a single widget instance. It's useful for highlighting and promoting easy comprehension of key metrics. Additionally, each KPI within a widget instance can visualize associated thresholds via a dynamic background color indicating whether a certain threshold has been reached.
