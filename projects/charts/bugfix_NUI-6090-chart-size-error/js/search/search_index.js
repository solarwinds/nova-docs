intersection of source line data with given threshold zones and generates start / end for status periods.\nOtherwise it will use the start and the end of the band.\nThe default value of the rendererConfig parameter is THRESHOLDS_MAIN_CHART_RENDERER_CONFIG.

Overview\nNova Charts is a library created to provide potential consumers with solutions for various data visualizations that conform with the Nova Design Language. It's designed to solve common patterns identified by UX designers, but also be very flexible so that pieces of visualizations can be overridden or entirely new visualizations can be customized quickly. As with anything, the more customizations you wish to have, the more work and maintenance you will absorb within your own app's code.\nGetting Started\nGetting started with charts is quite simple:\n\nInclude charts in your package.json file\n \"devDependencies\": {\n     ...\n     \"@nova-ui/charts\": >>last release version\n\n\nAdd a reference to charts styles in your angular.json file. Without this step, the charts will render, but will look and act in unpredictable ways.\n \"projects\": {\n     \"your-project\": {\n         ...\n         \"architect\": {\n             ...\n             \"styles\": [\n                 \"src/styles.less\",\n                 \"./node_modules/@nova-ui/bits/bundles/css/styles.css\",\n                 \"./node_modules/@nova-ui/charts/bundles/css/styles.css\"\n              ],\n\n\nImport NuiChartsModule\n import { NuiChartsModule } from \"@nova-ui/charts\";\n\n @NgModule({\n     declarations: [ ... ],\n     imports: [ NuiChartsModule ],\n     exports: [ ... ],\n     providers: [ ... ]\n })\nCopy/Paste any of our examples (see TOC below) to create your own component, add it to your view and then play around with the options.\n\n\nTOC\n\nLayout\nChart Types\nLine\nBar\nBucketed Bar\nStatus\nWaterfall\n\n\nPie and Donut\nSpark\n\n\nPlugins\nTooltips\nPopovers\n\n\nThresholds\nTimeframe Selection\nAdvanced Usage\nChart\nLegend\nInput Structure\nData\nColors\nMarkers\n\n\nEvents\nGrid\nScales\nDomains\nFormatters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
